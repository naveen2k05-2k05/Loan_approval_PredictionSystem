# Loan Approval Prediction System

## 📌 Overview
The Loan Approval Prediction System is a supervised machine learning project that predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant financial and employment details. The project demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow commonly used in real-world banking and financial analytics.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze applicant data to predict loan approval outcomes  
- Apply supervised machine learning techniques for classification  
- Evaluate model performance using standard ML metrics  

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression  
- Problem Type: Binary Classification (Approved / Not Approved)  

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

---

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Handle missing values using statistical methods  
3. Encode categorical features  
4. Split data into training and testing sets  
5. Train a Logistic Regression model  
6. Evaluate performance using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
